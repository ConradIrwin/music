Welcome to my collection of music, or at least the ones I've got round to
type-setting.

## Contributing

I primarily use [Lilypond](https://www.lilypond.org).  The [GUI for OS
X](http://www.lilypond.org/macos-x.html) is pretty good, otherwise the command
line works just fine.

Feel free to send pull requests or file issues, I think it would be fun :).
